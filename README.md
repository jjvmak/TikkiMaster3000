# TikkiMaster3000
Player vs computer Trick-taking game (tikki)

Development and bug fixing is still unfinished, but the main logic of the game is working properly and game is playable. 

Enemy's (computer) logic is moderately working right now and it will know what cards it should play. There are still some unsolved bugs and issues in enemy's logic.

The output window is purely for developing the the enemy's logic and will remain there, until the issues are solved.
